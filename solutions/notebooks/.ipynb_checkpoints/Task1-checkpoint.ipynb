    "<span class=\"c5\">Although the plot specifies the x-axis to be in nanometers, I have taken the unit to be in Angstrom (</span><span class=\"c19 c33\">Å)</span><span class=\"c5 c8\"> instead. My reasoning for this is as follows:</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "**<span class=\"c5\">Assumption :</span><span class=\"c8 c37 c43\"> We're dealing with the gas in vacuum, and not air.</span>**\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"c8 c5\">Using the Rydberg formula for calculating the wavelengths corresponding to the transitions of Hydrogen, we note that:</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"c5\">(a) The shortest wavelength possible is approximately 911.7</span> <span class=\"c0\">Å.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"c5\">(b) The longest wavelength possible is approximately 1215.7</span> <span class=\"c0\">Å.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"c5\">Ignoring the unit for now, we can see that the value from (a) corresponds to the \"Plunge\" at around 900, and the dip at around 1220 also lines up with the value from (b). This leads me to believe that the true unit for the x-axis might not be in nm. The reference cited in the question (</span><span class=\"c18 c19\">[https://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/Handbook/Tables/hydrogentable2.htm](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/Handbook/Tables/hydrogentable2.htm&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1616619658701000&usg=AOvVaw2PETS8nukkv-GbAi98HvI1)</span><span class=\"c5\">) also appears to corroborate this, as the units provided in the tables there are also in</span> <span class=\"c19\">Å</span><span class=\"c8 c5\"> and not nm.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"c5\">For Hydrogen to have transitions in the nm range, the transitions would have to correspond to the Paschen series. But the lower limit for wavelengths of Hydrogen in the series is at around 821 nm, which despite being present on the x axis, does not show any corresponding changes in the y-axis. This observation also is in agreement with the assumption that the unit is probably not nm, but rather</span> <span class=\"c19\">Å</span><span class=\"c8 c5\"> instead.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"c19\">Hence, I have assumed the true unit of the x-axis to be in Å and not nm for this task (both parts A and B). This assumption has also been verified and confirmed by Shravan Choudhari.</span>\n",

    "<span class=\"c1\">The plot in figure (1) has been obtained by plotting wavelength in Angstrom (Å) versus the relative flux. Here, the relative flux is a measurement of the intensity of light observed at a particular wavelength (λ) from an assumed datum. As we are dealing with an absorption spectra, a dip in the relative flux at any given wavelength is assumed to be an indication of the presence of a material which absorbs the electromagnetic radiations. The wavelength these absorptions can be deduced by using Rydberg’s equation (below).</span>\n",
